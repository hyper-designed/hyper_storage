/// A function that takes an object of type [E] and returns its ID as a string.
///
/// This typedef is used to define how objects are identified within a storage
/// container. When provided, it allows the container to extract IDs from
/// objects rather than generating new IDs.
///
/// Parameters:
///   * [object] - The object from which to extract the ID.
///
/// Returns:
///   A string representing the unique identifier for the object.
typedef IdGetter<E> = String Function(E object);

/// A function that serializes an object of type [E] to a string.
///
/// This typedef is used to define the serialization logic for objects
/// stored in a [SerializableStorageContainer]. The function should convert
/// the object into a string format suitable for storage (e.g., JSON).
typedef SerializeCallback<E> = String Function(E value);

/// A function that deserializes a string back to an object of type [E].
///
/// This typedef is used to define the deserialization logic for objects
/// stored in a [SerializableStorageContainer]. The function should convert

/// An abstract class that provides a container for storing serializable objects
/// of type [E].
///
/// This class extends [StorageContainer] and implements
/// [SerializableStorageOperationsApi], providing a comprehensive set of CRUD
/// operations for storing, retrieving, and managing serializable objects. Each
/// object is associated with a unique ID, which can either be extracted from
/// the object using an [IdGetter] or automatically generated.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Object Storage**: Store and retrieve typed objects, not just primitives
/// - **Automatic Serialization**: Objects are automatically serialized to
///   strings for storage
/// - **ID Management**: Supports both custom ID extraction and automatic ID
///   generation
/// - **Batch Operations**: Efficiently handle multiple objects at once with
///   `setAll`, `addAll`, etc.
/// - **Type Safety**: Generic type parameter ensures type-safe operations
/// - **Full CRUD Support**: Complete create, read, update, delete functionality
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// To use this class, you must:
/// 1. Extend it and provide a type parameter
/// 2. Implement [serialize] to convert objects to strings
/// 3. Implement [deserialize] to convert strings back to objects
///
/// ## ID Management
///
/// The container supports two modes for managing object IDs:
///
/// ### Custom ID Extraction
/// Provide an [IdGetter] function to extract IDs from objects:
/// ```dart
/// SerializableStorageContainer<User>(
///   backend: backend,
///   name: 'users',
///   idGetter: (user) => user.id,  // Extract ID from object
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ### Automatic ID Generation
/// If no [IdGetter] is provided, IDs are automatically generated:
/// ```dart
/// SerializableStorageContainer<Note>(
///   backend: backend,
///   name: 'notes',
///   // No idGetter - IDs will be auto-generated
/// );
/// ```
///
/// Subclasses must implement:
/// - [serialize]: Convert an object of type [E] to a [String]
/// - [deserialize]: Convert a [String] back to an object of type [E]
///
/// See also:
/// - [StorageContainer] for the base container functionality
/// - [SerializableStorageOperationsApi] for the operation interface
/// - [IdGetter] for custom ID extraction
abstract class SerializableStorageContainer<E> extends StorageContainer implements SerializableStorageOperationsApi<E> {
  /// An optional function that extracts the ID from an object.
  ///
  /// When provided, this function is used to determine the ID of objects
  /// passed to methods like [add], [update], [removeItem], etc. If not
  /// provided, the container will automatically generate IDs using
  /// [generateId]. [generateId] generates a random, unique string ID.
  /// Random object can be configured via the constructor.
  ///
  /// The extracted ID must be a valid storage key and must not contain the
  /// container's delimiter. If the function returns an invalid ID, an
  /// [ArgumentError] will be thrown.
  final IdGetter<E>? idGetter;

  /// Internal random number generator used for ID generation.
  ///
  /// This is used by [generateId] to create unique identifiers when no
  /// [idGetter] is provided. The generator can be seeded for deterministic
  /// behavior in testing scenarios.
  final Random _random;

  /// Creates a new [SerializableStorageContainer].
  ///
  /// The constructor initializes a container for storing serializable objects
  /// with support for custom ID extraction or automatic ID generation. It
  /// sets up the random number generator for ID generation, using either a
  /// provided generator, a seeded generator, or one seeded with the backend's
  /// hash code for deterministic behavior.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  ///   * [idGetter] - Optional. A function that extracts the ID from an object.
  ///     If not provided, IDs will be automatically generated using
  ///     [generateId]. The extracted ID must be a valid storage key.
  ///   * [backend] - The storage backend to use for persistence operations.
  ///   * [name] - The name of the container, used for namespacing keys.
  ///   * [delimiter] - Optional. The character(s) used to separate the
  ///     container name from keys. If not provided, uses the default delimiter.
  ///   * [random] - Optional. A custom random number generator for ID
  ///     generation. Useful for testing or when specific randomness
  ///     characteristics are needed.
  ///   * [seed] - Optional. A seed value for the random number generator. If
  ///     neither [random] nor [seed] is provided, the backend's hash code is
  ///     used as the seed for deterministic behavior across container
  ///     recreations.
