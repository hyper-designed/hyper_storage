/// The main entry point for the HyperStorage library, providing centralized
/// storage management with a singleton pattern.
///
/// [HyperStorage] serves as the primary interface for all storage operations,
/// managing containers and providing direct access to storage functionality.
/// It implements a singleton pattern to ensure consistent access to storage
/// across your application while supporting multiple storage backends.
///
/// Before using [HyperStorage], you must initialize it with a backend.
///
/// Container-Based Storage: Containers provide namespaced storage for better organization:
///
/// JSON Serializable Containers: Store custom objects with automatic JSON serialization:
///
/// Supports Custom Serializable Containers: For advanced use cases, create custom container implementations.
///
/// [HyperStorage] uses a singleton pattern which is safe for concurrent access
/// within a single isolate. For multi-isolate access, ensure your backend
/// supports it or implement proper synchronization.
///
/// ## Container Caching
///
/// Containers are cached by name. Requesting the same container multiple times
/// returns the same instance.
///
/// See also:
/// - [StorageContainer] for basic container functionality
/// - [JsonStorageContainer] for JSON serialization
/// - [SerializableStorageContainer] for custom object storage
/// - [StorageBackend] for implementing custom backends

  /// [container] method. Containers are cached to ensure the same instance
  /// is returned for repeated requests with the same name, maintaining
  /// consistency of listeners and state.
